\section{Objectives}
Objective of our study was to develop an efficient computational
workflow for processing atmospheric science data sets to address data
quality issues. Workflow was designed to 1) allow for easy and intuitive
data quality issue reporting system to encourage data correction in
addition to reproting; 2) automation of data reprocessing to reduce
human intervention and thus maximizing efficiency; 3) parallel
processing of large data volumes; 4) systematic process verification and
version control; 5) capture provenance information at each step; and 6)
clearly communication to all stakeholders about any update to the data.
