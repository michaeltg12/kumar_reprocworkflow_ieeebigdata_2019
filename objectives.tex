\section{Objectives}
The objective of our study was to develop an efficient computational
workflow for processing atmospheric science data sets to address data
quality issues. This workflow was designed to 1) allow for easy and intuitive
data quality issue reporting system to encourage data correction in
addition to reporting; 2) automate data reprocessing to reduce
human intervention and thus maximize efficiency; 3)
process a large volume of datasets in parallel; 4) provide systematic process verification and
version control; 5) capture provenance information at each step; and 6)
clearly communicate  any updates to the data to all stakeholders.
