\section{Conclusions}
Data quality management and improvements for large scientific data sets
like those managed by Atmospheric Radiation Measurement program pose a
complex big data challenge. We described a provenance-aware
computational workflow for data quality management and improvement for 
Petascale archive of thousands of science data streams from hundreds of
instruments across the globe. End-to-end workflow enables collection of
data quality issues for any data set to its processing and archival
while tracking provenance information during each step of the data
processing life cycle. Workflow enables the capability for symbolic
equation processing that allows for instruments experts to provide
quality improvement suggestions in an easy format while automating the
data reprocessing pipe in a effective high performance computing environment. 
Provenance aware framework logs all pertinent information which are also
communicated with all relevant users and stakeholders. Developed
workflow would enable the fast resolution of data quality issues within
ARM and provide better quality atmospheric science data to broader
science users.
