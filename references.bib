abstract="The data quality assessment (DQA) process has the lack of sufficient attention on enterprise infomationization, and existing technologies and methods have their limitations. In order to solve data quality(DQ) problems from the source and realize the traceability of data,after research on data provenance technology and determining the idea of achieving the way data can be traced, the framework of data quality assessment based on data provenance and SOA is presented. Then the logical architecture is described, simultaneously core technology are focus to analyze. Finally, specific application is discussed and the direction of further work is given.",

            SymPy is an open source computer algebra system written in pure Python. It is built with a focus on extensibility and ease of use, through both interactive and programmatic applications. These characteristics have led SymPy to become a popular symbolic library for the scientific Python ecosystem. This paper presents the architecture of SymPy, a description of its features, and a discussion of select submodules. The supplementary material provide additional examples and further outline details of the architecture and features of SymPy.
