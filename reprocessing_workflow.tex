\section{Workflow for data quality improvement}
ARM data reprocessing to address data quality issue was
designed as an end-to-end workflow from collection of data quality
issues and concern, reprocessing for data quality improvement, review
for accuracy, versioning and archival and user notification (Figure~\ref{fig:flowchart}).
The computational workflow for reprocess data to address data quality
issue was developed in Python programming language. The software
framework was designed for computational performance and cross-platform
compatibility.
