\section{Data provenance tracking}
Accuracy and reproducibility is essential component of sound and
reliable scientific research and analysis. Capturing rigorous provenance
information at every step of data life cycle is critical to allow
reproducible science. Data reprocessing workflow for data quality
improvement modifies the data from its original version and its
paramount that the provenance of the data be comprehensively captured.
While the technical details of the data quality issue and it is
implication are detailed in the DQR, the reprocessing workflow was
designed to log details of every step of the processing including
versioned filenames of each data file processed, variables recalculated,
symbolic equations applied for processing, softwares including versions
used in processing, computing systems used etc. A subset of provenance
information relevant for scientific users of the data was also appended
to the DQR, that is distributed along with the data.
