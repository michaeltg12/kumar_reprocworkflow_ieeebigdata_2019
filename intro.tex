\section{Introduction}
Rapid growth in observational technologies and data management and
sharing infrastructure has enabled a new era of big data enabled science
discovery in wide range of disciplines. However, ensuring the high
quality of the data is crucial for accurate and reliable scientific
research and decision making. Management of data quality especially
presents challenges for environmental monitoring networks that operate
large numbers of distributed facilities in remote regions of the world,
like U.S. Department of Energy's Atmospheric Radiation Measurement (ARM)
program (\url{https://arm.gov}). Needed is a framework for data quality 
assessment for data from diverse source and automated methods for data
quality improvement. Equally important is to capture the provenance at
every step of
the data life cycle that are comprehensive, timely and transparently
communicated to the data users.
In this paper we describe a provenance-aware workflow for
data quality management and improvement for continuously growing
atmospheric science data streams within ARM's petascale-archive.
