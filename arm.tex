\section{Atmospheric Radiation Measurement}
For 30 years and counting since its inception in 1990
\cite{Turner_AMS_2016}, ARM program has
been collecting observations across the globe to advance the robust
predictive understanding of Earth's climate and environmental systems
and to inform the development of sustainable solutions to the Nation's
energy and environmental challenges. Deployed across three atmospheric
observatories, three mobile facilities and aerial facilities, data are
continuously being collected from 480 scientific instruments and
sensors. With 1.7 Petabyte and growing archive of data, ARM makes
available to the scientific community, publicly and freely,
approximately 8218 datastreams of which 1220 are actively growing in
near-real-time with data streaming from the instruments around the
world.
